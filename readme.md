# ðŸ§¬ Multi-threads Agent-based Simulation Framework


This is a multi-threaded Agent-Based Model framework designed for simulating complex systems such as disease transmission and information diffusion in social networks. Developed using Repast Simphony, the model efficiently handles dynamic interactions in large-scale agent populations through parallel computing technology.
